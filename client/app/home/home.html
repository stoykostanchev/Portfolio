                <h2> What is Mindcache? </h2>
                <p> Mindcache is a blog-like web site. It is a place, where  
                I could share my thoughts and experience with the world. </p>

                <h2>Why Mindcache?</h2>
                <p>Mind is responsible for memory.</p>
                <p>Caching is a way in programming to speed up data access, most often by moving a copy of it to a place, 
                that has lower access time. Cached data could be erased from the source, but still be available to 
                the instance, using the cache.</p>
                <p>Mindcache is an online site, where one could look for synthesized information, or just browse to see what else 
                is stored in the cache.</p>
