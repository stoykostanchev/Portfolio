            What is Mindcache?
            </h1>
            <p>
            Mindcache is a blog-like web site. It is a place, where  
            I could share my thoughts and experience with the world.  
            </p>
            <h1>
            Why Mindcache?
            </h1>
            <p>Mind is responsible for memory.</p>
            <p>
            Caching is a way in programming to speed up data access, most often by moving a copy of it to a place, 
            that has lower access time. Cached data could be erased from the source, but still be available to 
            the instance, using the cache.</p>
            <p>Mindcache is an online site, where one could look for synthesized information, or just browse to see what else 
            is stored in the cache.
            </p>
