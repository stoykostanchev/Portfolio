            What IS Mindcache?
            </h1>
            <p>
            Mindcache is a blog-like web site, developed for personal use by me - Stoyko Stanchev. The initial
            idea was for me to get a portfolio up and running, but that later progressed into a place, where I 
            could share any of my thoughts and experiance with whoever is interested, even if it's just me at a 
            future point in time.
            </p>
            <h1>
            Why Mindcache?
            </h1>
            <p>
            Caching is a way in programming to speed up data access, most often by moving a copy of it to a place, 
            that has lower access time. Cached data could be erased from the source, but still be available to 
            the instance, using the cache.
            One of the things the Mind is responsible about is memory. Mindcache is a place, where one could look up stuff,
            that one has seen before, but forgotten the details for. Or just browse for random topics to see what else 
            is in the cache.
            </p>
