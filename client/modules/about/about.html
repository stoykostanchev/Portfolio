    My name is Stoyko Stanchev. I'm 26 years old, about 8 of which I have spent involved with programming of some kind.
    Last 3 years I have made living out of web development for a small-to-become-medium company, using PHP and Javascript.
    I like appliying and thinking about algorithms and design patterns, as well as obtaining deep understanding of the technologies I am using.
    <!--As a JS framework we used ExtJs, which I like alot - very good support and documentation, great ideas and practices applied,-->
    <!--and also one of the only frameworks out there that enable you to create entire single page application without any line of HTML or CSS.-->
    </p>

        Aside from programming I am into volleyball, chess, dancing and meeting new people.
